# clock_28hr

This app showcases time in a 28-hour format, simulating a week with 5 days, each spanning 28 hours. It references 2023-10-09T04:00:00Z as day zero. Additionally, the app features a clock widget for convenient home screen time viewing. I developed this app to practice Flutter and Dart, I don't intend to update or maintain it further.

## Running the app
Clone the repository and run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
